# 5. MATPLOTLIB #

# plotting library for python
# Commits: 26,201  Contributors: 736
# used for visualization

# it provides an object-oriented API for embedding plots into applications

# Features of matplotlib #

# as usable as matlab with an advantage of being free and open-source
# supports dozens of backends output types
# pandas itself can be used as wrappers around matplotlib's API
# smaller memory consumption & better runtime behaviour

# Applications of matplotlib #

# correlation analysis of variable
